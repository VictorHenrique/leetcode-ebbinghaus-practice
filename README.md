# LeetCode Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve Practice

<img align="right" src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo-Ae-Chun/publication/324816198/figure/fig1/AS:620205050982405@1524879815703/Ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve-and-review-cycle.png" width=400>

[Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) hypothesized that the speed of forgetting depends on a number of factors such as the difficulty of the learned material (e.g. how meaningful it is), its representation and other physiological factors such as stress and sleep. He further hypothesized that the basal forgetting rate differs little between individuals. He concluded that the difference in performance can be explained by mnemonic representation skills.

He went on to hypothesize that basic training in mnemonic techniques can help overcome those differences in part. He asserted that the best methods for increasing the strength of memory are:

- better memory representation (e.g. with mnemonic techniques)
- repetition based on active recall (especially spaced repetition).

His premise was that each repetition in learning increases the optimum interval before the next repetition is needed (for near-perfect retention, initial repetitions may need to be made within days, but later they can be made after years). He discovered that information is easier to recall when it's built upon things you already know, and the forgetting curve was flattened by every repetition. It appeared that by applying frequent training in learning, the information was solidified by repeated recalling.

## LeetCode
